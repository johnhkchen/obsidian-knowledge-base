# START HERE - Critical Setup Instructions

üö® **READ THIS FIRST** - These instructions are based on extensive testing and will save you hours of debugging.

## TL;DR - Skip the Broken Init, Use What Works

The `my-little-soda init` command has several bugs, but the **core workflow is excellent**. Follow these steps to bypass initialization issues and get straight to productive work:

## Quick Start (Proven Working Method)

### 1. Set Environment Variables
```bash
export GITHUB_OWNER=johnhkchen
export GITHUB_REPO=obsidian-knowledge-base
```

### 2. Create Required Labels (One Time Only)
The labels may already exist, but if not:
```bash
gh label create "route:ready" --description "Available for agent assignment" --color "0052cc"
gh label create "route:review" --description "Under review" --color "fbca04"
gh label create "route:priority-high" --description "High priority task" --color "b60205"
# (Additional labels will be created automatically)
```

### 3. Skip Init - Go Straight to Core Workflow
```bash
# Check status (this works even without proper init)
./my-little-soda status

# See available work
./my-little-soda peek

# Claim your first task
./my-little-soda pop
```

**That's it!** The core workflow is fully functional and will guide you through the rest.

## What We Learned Through Testing

### ‚ùå Init Command Issues (Skip These Headaches)
- Legacy "clambake" references throughout (confusing but harmless)
- Fails on label creation if labels already exist
- Configuration persistence problems
- Requires very specific git state to succeed
- **Bottom Line**: Don't waste time debugging init - the core tool works perfectly

### ‚úÖ What Actually Works Great
- `./my-little-soda status` - Shows agent status and available work
- `./my-little-soda peek` - Preview next task without claiming
- `./my-little-soda pop` - Claim issue, create branch, assign work
- `./my-little-soda bottle` - Complete work, manage labels, create PR

### üéØ The Proven Workflow
1. **`pop`** - Claims GitHub issue, creates descriptive branch, assigns to agent001
2. **Work** - Make your changes on the agent branch
3. **`bottle`** - Pushes branch, changes labels, frees agent for next task

## Your Mission

GitHub Issues #2-5 contain your Obsidian setup tasks:
- **Issue #2**: CouchDB Docker container setup
- **Issue #3**: Database configuration  
- **Issue #4**: HTTPS reverse proxy
- **Issue #5**: Obsidian desktop client setup

## Getting Started Right Now

```bash
# 1. Set your environment
export GITHUB_OWNER=johnhkchen
export GITHUB_REPO=obsidian-knowledge-base

# 2. Check what's available
./my-little-soda peek

# 3. Claim your first task  
./my-little-soda pop

# 4. Follow the detailed instructions in the GitHub issue
# 5. Complete the work on your agent branch
# 6. When done: ./my-little-soda bottle
```

## Troubleshooting

**If you see "missing field `owner`" warnings**: Ignore them - they don't affect functionality

**If commands fail**: Double-check environment variables are set

**If you're curious about the testing**: See `knowledge/tech/my-little-soda-testing-report.md` for full details

## What Makes This Tool Excellent

Despite init issues, my-little-soda has:
- Sophisticated agent coordination with atomic assignments
- Automatic branch naming based on issue titles  
- Smart label management and issue lifecycle
- GitHub Actions integration for automated workflows
- Excellent error handling and user guidance

**The core engine is production-ready** - just bypass the buggy initialization!
