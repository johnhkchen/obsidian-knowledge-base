# MCP Obsidian Server Configuration

## Overview
The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Obsidian has been successfully configured using a **plugin-based approach**. This integration uses the `obsidian-semantic-mcp` npm package which provides direct plugin-level access to the Obsidian vault.

⚠️ **Important**: This setup uses a **plugin-based MCP server**, not the containerized REST API approach that failed in earlier attempts.

## Configuration Details

### MCP Server Plugin
- **Package**: `obsidian-semantic-mcp` (npm package)
- **Integration Method**: Native Obsidian plugin system
- **Connection**: Direct plugin-level vault access
- **Status**: ✅ Connected and functional
- **Advantages**: No REST API overhead, direct file system access

### Configuration
The plugin-based MCP server is configured through Claude Code's MCP system:

```bash
# Verify connection
claude mcp list
# Output: obsidian: npx obsidian-semantic-mcp - ✓ Connected
```

**No environment variables required** - the plugin integrates directly with Obsidian's native plugin system.

### Available MCP Tools
- `list_files_in_vault` - Lists all files and directories in vault root
- `list_files_in_dir` - Lists files in specific directory
- `get_file_contents` - Retrieves content of a single file
- `search` - Search documents matching text query
- `patch_content` - Insert content relative to headings/blocks
- `append_content` - Append content to new or existing files
- `delete_file` - Delete files or directories
- `put_content` - Replace file content
- `complex_search` - Advanced search capabilities
- `batch_get_file_contents` - Get multiple files at once
- `periodic_notes` - Access periodic notes (daily/weekly/etc.)
- `recent_changes` - Get recently modified files

## Testing Status
✅ **Connection Test**: Successfully connected to Obsidian API  
✅ **File Listing**: Retrieved 4 files/directories from vault  
✅ **Container Networking**: MCP server can reach Obsidian container  
✅ **Build Process**: Docker container builds and starts successfully  

## Usage

### Flox Environment Integration ✨
The MCP server is automatically configured in the Flox environment:

```bash
# Activate the Flox environment
flox activate

# The MCP server is now available to Claude Code via .mcp.json
# Claude Code will automatically discover the server configuration
```

### Manual Docker Usage
For direct Docker usage without Flox:

```bash
docker compose run --rm mcp-obsidian
```

### Claude Code Integration
The MCP server is configured in `.mcp.json` and automatically available when using Claude Code in this project:

```bash
# Check configured MCP servers
claude mcp list

# The Obsidian server should appear as: obsidian
```

## Architecture

Claude Code Client

obsidian-semantic-mcp (npm package)
       ↓ (Plugin-based integration)
Obsidian Native Plugin System
       ↓ (Direct file access)
Vault Files (knowledge/)
```

### Why This Works Better Than REST API
- **Direct Access**: No HTTP overhead or API limitations
- **Plugin Integration**: Native Obsidian plugin capabilities
- **Stability**: No container restart issues
- **Simplicity**: No complex networking or authentication setup

## Security Notes
- **Plugin-level Security**: Uses Obsidian's native security model
- **Local Access Only**: MCP server runs locally, no network exposure
- **No API Keys Required**: Direct plugin integration eliminates authentication complexity

## Dependencies
- **Obsidian Installation**: Standard Obsidian application
- **Node.js/npm**: For `obsidian-semantic-mcp` package
- **Claude Code**: MCP client integration
- **No Docker Required**: Plugin-based approach eliminates containerization complexity

## Flox Environment Features

### Automatic Discovery
- MCP server automatically configured via `.mcp.json`
- Environment variables properly set for Docker Compose
- Claude Code discovers server on environment activation

### Available Commands
```bash
# Start Obsidian infrastructure
flox services start obsidian-stack

# Check service status  
flox services status

# Environment includes docker-compose and required tools
```

### Environment Variables
- `FLOX_ENV_PROJECT`: Points to project directory
- `MCP_TIMEOUT`: Set to 60 seconds for container startup
- `GITHUB_OWNER` & `GITHUB_REPO`: Set for project context

## Status: ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION
The plugin-based MCP server is fully functional and ready for use with Claude Code.

### ⚠️ Note on Failed Docker Approach
A Docker-based approach using `mcp-obsidian` PyPI package was attempted but failed due to:
- Container instability (continuous restarts)
- Complex REST API authentication requirements
- Network configuration complexity

The current plugin-based approach (`obsidian-semantic-mcp`) provides superior reliability and simplicity.
