# MCP Setup Investigation Mission

> **Status**: üö® CRITICAL - Documentation Discrepancy Detected  
> **Issue**: [#25](https://github.com/johnhkchen/obsidian-knowledge-base/issues/25)  
> **Priority**: `route:unblocker`  
> **Agent Instructions**: READ THIS FIRST

## üéØ Mission Overview

**Problem**: Our documentation contains conflicting information about our MCP setup. We need to establish ground truth before users get incorrect instructions.

**Your Mission**: Investigate actual setup, ask user questions, document findings, correct all documentation.

## üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

### DO NOT ASSUME ANYTHING

**Before making ANY changes to documentation:**
1. **Ask the user directly** - they have ground truth
2. **Investigate technically** - verify claims against actual system  
3. **Document uncertainties** - say "I need more information" vs guessing
4. **Test your findings** - ensure setup actually works

### Questions to Ask User

**Required before proceeding:**
1. What MCP server are we actually using? (npm package vs native plugin vs other)
2. How was it installed? (BRAT vs npm vs docker vs other method) 
3. What's the actual connection method? (REST API vs direct vs other)
4. Can you show the exact installation steps you used?
5. What does `claude mcp list` show exactly?
6. Which Obsidian plugins are actually installed for MCP functionality?

## üîç Technical Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Examine Current System

```bash
# Check MCP server status
claude mcp list

# List Obsidian plugin directory structure  
mcp__obsidian__vault(action="list", directory=".obsidian")

# Check installed plugins
mcp__obsidian__vault(action="read", path=".obsidian/community-plugins.json")

# Search for MCP-related configurations
mcp__obsidian__vault(action="search", query="MCP OR REST API OR semantic")
```

### Step 2: Document Findings

**Create investigation report here:**
`Obsidian MCP Tests/MCP Setup Investigation/Investigation Report.md`

**Include:**
- Exact MCP server configuration found
- Plugin installation evidence
- Network/API connection details  
- Discrepancies between docs and reality
- Questions that need user clarification

### Step 3: Verify Integration

**Test current setup:**
- Try MCP operations to confirm they work
- Document exact data flow and connection method
- Note any limitations or issues

## üìã Investigation Workspace

**Use this folder for all investigation work:**
- `Investigation Report.md` - Main findings document
- `User Questions.md` - Questions needing clarification
- `Technical Findings.md` - Evidence from system investigation
- `Documentation Discrepancies.md` - Conflicts found across docs
- `Corrected Setup Guide.md` - Final verified setup (after investigation)

## üõ†Ô∏è MCP Tools for Investigation

**Key Operations:**
```bash
# Directory exploration
mcp__obsidian__vault(action="list", directory="<path>")

# Read configuration files
mcp__obsidian__vault(action="read", path="<config_file>")

# Search across vault  
mcp__obsidian__vault(action="search", query="<terms>")

# Create investigation documents
mcp__obsidian__vault(action="create", path="<investigation_file>", content="<findings>")

# Update findings incrementally
mcp__obsidian__edit(action="append", path="<report>", content="<new_findings>")
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Work Rules

### Investigation Phase
1. **Start with user questions** - Don't skip this step
2. **Document everything** - Evidence-based findings only
3. **Admit gaps** - "I need to investigate X" vs making it up
4. **Ask for help** - User knows the real setup

### Documentation Phase (Only After Investigation)
1. **Update systematically** - Fix all related docs together
2. **Test instructions** - Ensure setup guide actually works
3. **Cross-reference properly** - Keep all docs aligned
4. **Preserve working setup** - Don't break what's already working

## üéØ Success Definition

**Investigation Complete When:**
- [ ] User has confirmed actual setup method
- [ ] Technical findings match user report
- [ ] All discrepancies documented with evidence
- [ ] Clear questions identified for any remaining gaps

**Documentation Complete When:**
- [ ] All technical docs reflect verified reality
- [ ] Setup guide tested and works
- [ ] No conflicting information across documentation
- [ ] Cross-references updated throughout vault

## üìû Getting Help

**If stuck or uncertain:**
1. Document exactly what you found vs what you expected
2. List specific questions that would resolve the uncertainty  
3. Ask user for clarification on those specific points
4. Don't guess - wait for authoritative answers

**Remember**: Better to say "I need more information" than to perpetuate incorrect documentation. The user has ground truth - use it!
