Today I set up [[My Little Soda]] on a fresh repository for a first time, and it successfully popped issues from GitHub! I used it to set up a Obsidian knowledge base, using some reddit post describing how to set up a multi-client, self hosted sync approach. It took a while but the ability to run Claude Code in concurrent repos really helped!

- [x] Began exploring MCP access to Obsidian
- [x] Set up issues on both `my-little-soda` and `obsidian-knowledge-base` projects to queue up future semi-attended agent work
- [ ] this is another
