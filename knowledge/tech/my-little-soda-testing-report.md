# User Test Report: my-little-soda init command

## Test Environment
- Platform: Linux x86-64
- Date: 2025-08-26
- Command tested: `./my-little-soda init`

## Key Issues Found

### 1. Legacy Naming Inconsistency
The tool still references the old project name "clambake" in multiple places:
- Error message: "Run setup: clambake init"
- Config path: ".clambake/credentials/github_owner"
- Log messages: "Clambake telemetry initialized" and "Clambake telemetry shutdown complete"

### 2. Configuration Requirements
- Missing GITHUB_OWNER and GITHUB_REPO environment variables
- Suggests creating `.clambake/credentials/github_owner` (should probably be `.my-little-soda/`)
- Configuration error: "missing field `owner`"

## Positive Observations

### 3. Good Error Handling
- Binary executable runs successfully
- Provides clear error messages with helpful quick fixes
- Suggests multiple solutions: environment variables, GitHub CLI, or setup command

### 4. Validation Flow
- GitHub CLI authentication check works: "✅ Verifying GitHub CLI authentication... ✅"
- Repository permissions validation attempted: "✅ Checking repository write permissions..."
- Clean structured logging output with timestamps

### 5. User Experience
- Clear phase-based output: "Phase 1: Validation"
- Helpful emoji indicators and formatting
- Comprehensive setup information displayed

## Recommendations

1. **Update all "clambake" references to "my-little-soda"**
2. **Update config directory from `.clambake/` to `.my-little-soda/`**
3. **Consider making the init command more self-contained for first-time setup**
4. **Ensure consistency between binary name and internal references**

## Critical Issue: Git Repository Assumptions

### 6. Fresh Project vs Existing Repository Conflict
- The tool assumes it's running in an existing git repository
- Error shows "✅ Checking repository write permissions..." but we're not in a git repo
- This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: 
  - Fresh projects (like this "obsidian" directory) have no git repo
  - Tool expects to validate repository permissions before proceeding
  - Unclear if init should initialize a git repo or requires one to exist

### 7. Repository Existence Assumptions
- Tool tries to check permissions on "johnhkchen/obsidian" repository
- This repository doesn't exist on GitHub yet
- Error: "Failed to access repository: GitHub. Check your GitHub token permissions."
- The tool should either:
  - Create the GitHub repository as part of init
  - Clearly indicate it requires an existing GitHub repository
  - Work locally first before requiring remote repository

## Overall Assessment

The tool shows good error handling and helpful guidance for users, but has several critical issues:
1. Legacy naming creates confusion about what tool the user is actually running
2. **Major design flaw**: Assumes existing git repository when "init" suggests it should work in fresh projects
3. The init command provides clear feedback and next steps, but may not work in the intended use case of initializing a new project
