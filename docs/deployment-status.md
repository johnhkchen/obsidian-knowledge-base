## Current Infrastructure Status ✅

### Completed Components

#### 1. Repository Structure ✅
- ✅ Complete Obsidian vault structure (knowledge/, docs/, templates/)
- ✅ `.obsidian/` configuration directory created
- ✅ `tools/` directory with my-little-soda binary
- ✅ README.md updated with correct tool paths
- ✅ Documentation structure complete

#### 2. CouchDB Database ✅
- ✅ CouchDB 3.5.0 container deployed and running
- ✅ Admin credentials configured
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ API responding correctly on port 5984
- ✅ Authentication working with admin credentials

#### 3. HTTPS Reverse Proxy ✅ 
- ✅ Nginx Proxy Manager container deployed
- ✅ Admin interface available on port 81
- ✅ HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports configured
- ✅ SSL certificate volumes configured
- ✅ Proxy ready for domain configuration

## Container Status
```bash
# Both containers running successfully
NAME                     STATUS
obsidian-couchdb         Up (healthy)
obsidian-proxy-manager   Up
```

## Next Steps - Manual Configuration Required

### 1. Nginx Proxy Manager Setup (5-10 minutes)
1. **Access Admin Interface**: http://your-server-ip:81
   - Default login: admin@example.com / changeme
   - **IMPORTANT**: Change credentials on first login

2. **Create Proxy Host**:
   - Domain: your-domain.com (must point to your server)
   - Forward to: `couchdb:5984`
   - Enable SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)
   - Force SSL redirect

### 2. DNS Configuration Required
- Point your domain to this server's IP address
- A record: `your-domain.com` → `server-public-ip`

### 3. Mobile Sync Testing
Once HTTPS is configured:
1. Install Obsidian on mobile device
2. Install LiveSync plugin
3. Configure: `https://your-domain.com`
4. Test sync functionality

## Access URLs

| Service | URL | Status | Notes |
|---------|-----|---------|-------|
| CouchDB Direct | http://localhost:5984 | ✅ Working | Internal only |
| CouchDB Admin | http://localhost:5984/_utils | ✅ Working | Internal only |
| Proxy Manager | http://server-ip:81 | ✅ Ready | Setup required |
| CouchDB via HTTPS | https://your-domain.com | ⏳ Pending | DNS + SSL setup |

## Security Notes
- ✅ CouchDB requires authentication
- ✅ Admin credentials configured (change recommended)
- ⏳ HTTPS not yet configured (pending domain setup)
- ⏳ External firewall rules not configured

## Files Created/Modified
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added Nginx Proxy Manager
- `docs/https-proxy-setup.md` - Complete setup guide
- `docs/deployment-status.md` - This status file
- `README.md` - Updated tool paths
- Repository structure completed

## Issues Addressed
- ✅ Issue #1: Repository structure initialization complete
- ✅ Issue #4: HTTPS reverse proxy infrastructure ready
- ⏳ Issue #7: Partial completion (infrastructure ready, manual config needed)

## Estimated Time to Complete Full Setup
- **Infrastructure**: ✅ Complete (0 minutes)
- **Domain + SSL Setup**: ⏳ 5-10 minutes (manual)
- **Mobile Testing**: ⏳ 5 minutes (after SSL)
- **Total Remaining**: ~15 minutes of manual configuration

The foundation is complete and ready for domain-specific configuration!
