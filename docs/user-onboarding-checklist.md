---

## Phase 3: Optimization & Best Practices (5 minutes)

### 3.1 Sync Settings Optimization
For better battery life on mobile:
- [ ] **Sync Interval**: Set to 30-60 seconds instead of real-time
- [ ] **Background Sync**: Enable but limit frequency
- [ ] **WiFi Only**: Consider enabling for large files

### 3.2 Security Verification
- [ ] **HTTPS**: Confirm using secure connection if available
- [ ] **Firewall**: Verify only authorized devices can access
- [ ] **Backup**: Confirm automatic backups are running

### 3.3 Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Large Files**: Move large attachments to separate folder
- [ ] **Sync Exclusions**: Configure .obsidian/workspace.json exclusion
- [ ] **Conflict Resolution**: Understand merge vs overwrite behavior

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation (10 minutes)

### 4.1 Multi-Device Sync Test
- [ ] **Create Note on Desktop**: Add new note with content
- [ ] **Verify on Mobile**: Wait for sync, confirm note appears
- [ ] **Edit on Mobile**: Modify content on mobile device
- [ ] **Verify on Desktop**: Confirm changes sync back

### 4.2 Conflict Resolution Test
- [ ] **Disconnect Mobile**: Turn off WiFi/data temporarily
- [ ] **Edit Same Note**: Modify same note on both devices
- [ ] **Reconnect Mobile**: Enable network and observe conflict handling
- [ ] **Resolve Conflicts**: Understand conflict resolution options

### 4.3 Offline Capability Test
- [ ] **Work Offline**: Create/edit notes without network
- [ ] **Verify Local Storage**: Confirm notes saved locally
- [ ] **Reconnect & Sync**: Test sync when connection restored

---
