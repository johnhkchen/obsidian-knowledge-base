# Obsidian Knowledge Base

Personal knowledge management system with self-hosted CouchDB sync, orchestrated using my-little-soda multi-agent workflow.

## Overview

This repository serves as:
- **Obsidian Vault**: Personal knowledge management and note-taking system
- **Self-hosted Sync**: CouchDB backend for cross-device synchronization  
- **Development Orchestration**: Uses my-little-soda for task management and automation

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and Initialize**
   ```bash
   gh repo clone johnhkchen/obsidian-knowledge-base
   cd obsidian-knowledge-base
   # my-little-soda binary will be provided by release pipeline
   ./tools/my-little-soda init
   ```

2. **Set up Infrastructure**
   - Check GitHub Issues for current tasks
   - Use `./tools/my-little-soda pop` to claim next setup task
   - Follow `docs/obsidian-setup-checklist.md` for complete setup

## Architecture

- **CouchDB**: Self-hosted database for note synchronization
- **Obsidian**: Desktop and mobile clients with local storage
- **LiveSync Plugin**: Encrypted sync between devices and CouchDB
- **Reverse Proxy**: HTTPS termination for mobile compatibility
- **my-little-soda**: Multi-agent task orchestration

```

## Workflow

1. **Issues as Tasks**: GitHub Issues drive all setup and maintenance work
2. **Agent Coordination**: my-little-soda assigns tasks to agents (branches)
3. **Automated Setup**: Infrastructure provisioning through orchestrated tasks
4. **Knowledge Capture**: Document learnings and processes in the vault

## Getting Started

The setup process is orchestrated through GitHub Issues and my-little-soda:

```bash
# Check current status
./tools/my-little-soda status

# See what work is available  
./tools/my-little-soda peek

# Claim and start working on next task
./tools/my-little-soda pop

# Complete work and create PR
./tools/my-little-soda bottle
```
